If for any reason the program can't find the path (folder delete or path not present in config file for example) the program will
ask you again to chose your desired folder.

## Project Structure 📂

- <b>/src/Main<b>             → application Main file
- <b>/src/GUI<b>              → Swing interface
- <b>/src/ManagingFile<b>     → core program logic, read and write of the files

## About the GUI 🖥️

The application is written in Java using Java Swing.
The GUI was initially created with AI assistance while I was learning Swing, but the program logic is entirely my own.
I understand and actively modify the generated code, and I plan to refactor the UI in future updates.

## Roadmap 📈

- [x] Core logic implementation
- [x] Initial Swing interface
- [ ] GUI refactor
- [ ] More customization options
